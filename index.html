          - How many different ways could runners place in a race?
          - With medals, order matters. Bob taking gold, Sally taking silver, and Sam taking bronze is not the same as Sally taking gold, Sam taking silver, and Bob taking bronze.
          - P(n, x) = n!/(n-x)!

          - AND: The probability of two different events both happening.
            - What is the probability you ride the Log Ride at an amusement park AND stay dry?
          - OR: The probability of either event happens.
            - What is the probability you draw a Jack OR a King from a standard deck of cards?
          - NOT: The probability of anything but a certain event happening.
            - What is the probability of NOT drawing a Jack from a standard deck of cards?

          - A random event is an event that has the same chance of happening as all other events.
          - A random sample is when all members of a population have the same chance of being selected, and then some are selected.
          - Statistics depends on randomness, often driven by a computerized selection of random numbers.

          - Probability is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of an event by the number of possible occurrences of that same event
          - Probability rule #1: All probabilities are between 0 and 1
          - Probability rule #2: If all possible outcomes are considered, the total of the individual outcome probabilities is equal to 1
          - Probability rule #3: The probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 - the probability of the event happening
          - For a combination, order doesn't matter
          - For a permutation, order matters
          - "Random" probably doesn't mean what you think it means
